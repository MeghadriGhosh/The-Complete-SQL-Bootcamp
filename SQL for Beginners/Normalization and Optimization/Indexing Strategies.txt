2. Indexing Strategies-

Indexes are critical for optimizing query performance, especially in large databases where searches, joins, and sorting operations can be expensive.

What is an Index?
An index is a data structure that allows the database to retrieve data faster. It can be created on one or more columns in a table, significantly improving query performance.

Example of Adding Indexes:
For the student-course system, common queries might involve fetching studentsâ€™ enrollments or looking up courses by instructor.

Indexing the StudentID and CourseID in the Enrollments table will improve performance when querying the data.

<Indexing1.sql>

These indexes help speed up queries like:

<Indexing2.sql>

Without indexing, the database would perform a full table scan to find matching rows, which could be inefficient for large datasets.
