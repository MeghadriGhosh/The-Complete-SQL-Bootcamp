3. Query Optimization Techniques-

To further optimize your database performance, here are some key query optimization techniques:

a) Use of Proper Indexing:
Proper indexing is one of the most powerful optimization strategies. Indexes can significantly improve the speed of read operations, especially when performing JOIN, WHERE, or ORDER BY queries.

b) Avoid SELECT * (Use Explicit Columns):
Fetching all columns from a table can lead to unnecessary data transfer, especially if only a few columns are needed.

c) Use LIMIT with Large Data Sets:
When querying large datasets, use LIMIT to restrict the number of returned rows and improve performance.

d) Query Execution Plan:
Use the EXPLAIN command to analyze the execution plan of your queries. It helps identify inefficiencies like full table scans or missing indexes.
