1. Database Design and Schema Creation-

Create SQL scripts that define the schema of a database. This can include table creation, relationships, primary and foreign keys, indexes, and constraints.

Example Project: Design a database for an e-commerce system with tables like Customers, Orders, Products, OrderDetails, etc.

Include ER diagrams to visually represent the database relationships (you can generate this from SQL tools like MySQL Workbench or draw.io).
